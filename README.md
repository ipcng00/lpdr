# DRAL$`^+`$ in Keras
An implementation of LPDR-based active learning algorithm referred to as Disagree Ratio for Active Learning Plus (DRAL$`^+`$. The LPDR is a measure of the sample's sensitiveness to the perturbation of the decision boundary, and it is based on the disagree metric between the decision boundary and its perturbation.
